  <h1><p style="text-align: center">THE MERIC AND THE TWISTED MAGIKILL</p></h1>
  <h2><b>Once upon a time there were a <span style="color: #CC7C39">magikill</span> and a <span style="color: #CC6745">meric</span></b></h2>
  <p><b>The Meric was always complaining of how hard was her job of healing troops. The magikill replied that it was not even not eaiser for him as an old person to stand on the battlefeild with his stick he got in his hand. He had to memorise spells whihc others could not, yet would he lag behind the rest of the army in terms of speed and attention. He was sure costly in terms of gold and mana. But he was still not that satisfied. The Meric agreed that all slow units except the giant and king got prirority and they were just used like wasted cans, thrown after use.
</b></p>
<br>
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif"><p>While they were discussing about their complains, the a general of Order Empire came to them and shouting that they were too slow. "We will come as we please, Why are you in a hurry?". The general explained that, "We are facing brutal difficulties in the battlefield. The chaos Empire are killing our  swordwrarths, and speartons. Graphically explained, we are on a low area of graph. If we had you two coming faster!"
</p>
<hr>
<P>The Old Magikill and the meric ran to to the battlefiel faster, hoping of seeing a line of troops still alive for their arrival. Just a clinge of his spell could destroy the enemies hopefully, or else their battle would be lost.
</P>
 <br>
 <P>After arriving at the battle field, They recieved an NOT an array of Troops but an array of Eclipsoral Electric Arrows(EEAs). The Meric with her electrical shield could block some of the arrows but some of them hurted the magikill. The General grabbed a shield and fieracly fighted the crawlers until none of them looked like alive.  The magikill was still in a comma, while the meri cwas trying to heal it of its wound.
"What are we going to do?", Just a moment after this word spitting out of the merics mouth, A pair of chaos bombers intensified the situation and they were suddendly surrounded by poison deads.
"I siad you two to be fast, Now look. Out fallen speartons and swordwraths have arisen from the ground AS a side effect of the poison. Now do you think you two are important in the army?"
The both regreted their misdeads of over underestimating their own abilities, and the effect it took on the pale face of the battlefeild.
However, Hope was not fully lost. If the meric could heal the broken magikill, a splash of his spells could eaisly kill those darn Eclipsors. But right now it was just a moment of only fighting.
</P>
<P>After a long long battle of hours, and re healing the wounds that woudl be wounded YET again by those EEAs, chaos bombers. A few reinforcements would come to handle as meat sheilds for the time being. By the time the general and the group could rest in a battle tent, The twisted Magikill woke up from his coma and sunderstood the situation.
With a few sprikles of his spells, the EEA shooters and the bombers could be succsesfully eliminated and the battle was won. Realising the moral, the meric and the magikill understood that.
</P>
<blockquote>Moral:"The loss of even a solider of army can lead to its ultimate defeat. thinking yourself too small  is the the wrong work to do for the twommorow. Be satisfied with what you have" </blockquote>
