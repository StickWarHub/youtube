     <h2>The two sowrdman and the fishing pond</h2>
     <p><span style="font-size: 11px">O</span>nce upon a time, There were two stick man. One was a <b>Swordwrath</b> and another one was an <b>Archidon</b>. In Inamorta, It was not common to see people fishing through #fishing instruments. They would use their weapons instead. So the archidon would just just his Bow and Arrow to catch fish and the sword man would use his sword. The sword battle tactics would make him a bit uncomfortable to fish with sword, but the <b>Archidon</b> could easily shoot his targets in the flowing waters and get so many fishes. Seeing his companion be in so of a difficult time in fishing with sowrd, He exclaimed,"Huh, How stupid are you! You can just use a Bow and arrow to fish properly." The swordwrath just listened and continued fishing. After an hour of stayign near the pond, a <b>crawler</b> suddendly attacked two companions. The <b>archer</b> pleaded, "HELP, I cant focus my arrow ! The crawler is too fast to even aim!". The swordwrath laughed, saying "Why are you having a soo difficult time. I can kill the <b>crawler</b> in a few hits." With collabaration, the <b>crawler</b> was defeated and the <b><span style="background-color: #CC7E30">archidon</span></b> realised that
"The archer was good at certain cases, the sword was good in certain cases.What did that mean"
